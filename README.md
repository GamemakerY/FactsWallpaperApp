## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
    cd [YourRepoName]
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    * **Create the environment:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    * **Activate the environment:**
        * **On Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell):**
            ```bash
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
    Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)` indicating the environment is active.

3.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
